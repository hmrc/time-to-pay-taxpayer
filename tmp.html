    <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RE: Notice to End Tenancy</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">This notice to end the tenancy is given in accordance with the lease which requires notice of: <span id="span_id_notice">1 MONTH</span>. The tenancy at the above property will end and be vacated on <span id="span_id_date_vacated">29/02/2020</span>.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">All of the contractual obligations set out in the tenancy agreement have been fulfilled. In particular, no damage has been caused to the property and there is no outstanding rent. The property will be left in the condition required by the tenancy agreement.</p>
    <p>Consequently, it is requested that the deposit of Â£<span id="span_id_deposit">1,792.50</span> be returned. Please send payment via the following method:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="span_id_payment_method">By transfer to account number: 13413183, sort-code: 09-01-29;<br>By BACS transfer.</span></p>
    <p>If you intend to withhold or deduct any sums from the deposit, please write to inform of such, setting out the reasons accordingly within five working days of the property being vacated.</p>
    <p>If we do not hear from you within five working days it may be assumed that you are withholding our deposit unfairly. We will therefore consider applying to the tenancy deposit protection service that safeguards my deposit to request an adjudication and final settlement.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Please confirm receipt of this letter and provide any further instructions regarding the vacation of the property <span class="">and arrangements for the return of keys.Please also confirm the name of the tenancy deposit protection service that the deposit is being held with.Please also confirm the name of Tenancy Deposit Scheme that the deposit is being held with.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Yours faithfully,</p>
